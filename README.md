ASP Boilerplate Position Module Implementation (Backend)
This document outlines the structured implementation of the Position module using ASP Boilerplate in an ASP.NET Core application.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**
**1. Entity Creation**
**Position Module:**
Define the attributes and properties of the Position entity.
Follow ASP Boilerplate conventions for entity creation. Refer to (https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Entities) for guidelines.
**2. Repository and Manager**
**Manager Interface and Implementation:**
Create a manager interface responsible for defining operations related to the Position entity.
Implement the manager interface with appropriate logic.
Utilize ASP Boilerplate's repository pattern for data access and management.
Refer to (https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Repositories) Documentation for detailed instructions.
**Points 1 and 2 will be implemented in the ASP.NET.Core layer**

**3. Application Service**
**DTO Creation:**
Define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for CRUD operations related to the Position entity.
DTOs should map to entity models and carry data between layers.
Follow ASP Boilerplate guidelines for DTO creation. Refer to 
(https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Data-Transfer-Objects) Documentation for more details.

**Application Service Interface and Implementation:**
**Define CRUD operations in an application service interface.**
Implement CRUD operations in the application service class, utilizing DTOs and manager operations.
Follow ASP Boilerplate standards for defining application services.
Refer to(https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Application-Services) Documentation for guidance.

**Note points in this Application service will be implemented in ASP.Net.ApplicationService layer**

**Additional Considerations**
**1. Dependency Injection (DI)**
Utilize ASP.NET Core's built-in Dependency Injection framework for managing dependencies.
Register services and components in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class.
Inject dependencies into controllers, services, and other components as needed.

**2. Mapping**
Consider using mapping libraries like AutoMapper for mapping between DTOs and entity models.
Automate the mapping process to reduce boilerplate code and potential errors.
Maintain a clear separation of concerns between layers by handling mapping logic appropriately.

**3. Validation**
Implement input validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and security.
Utilize ASP.NET Core's validation features, such as data annotations and model validation.
Validate user inputs at both client and server sides to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data consistency.

**4. Error Handling**
Implement proper error-handling mechanisms to provide a good user experience and maintain application stability.
Utilize ASP.NET Core's error-handling middleware, filters, and exception-handling mechanisms.
Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
**5. Unit Testing**
Write unit tests for repositories, application services, and other components to validate their behavior under different scenarios.

**Utilize ASP Boilerplate's support for unit testing to ensure the correctness and robustness of your application logic.
By following this structured approach and considering additional aspects such as dependency injection, mapping, validation, error handling, and unit testing, you can build a reliable, maintainable, and scalable ASP.NET Core application using ASP Boilerplate.**
